      <p>
      I'm 2nd year student perusing B-TECH in Computer science and Engineering.
      I found about this program through the open source community. I love open
      source. I think that as developers, we should band together to support the
      expansion and prosperity of the open source community. It will assist me
      in closing the gap between learning and truly implementing what we have
      learnt. It will provide me the opportunity to tackle problems in the real
      world. I've always believed in "learning by doing". It facilitated the
      growth of strong research skills. I now know how to handle the challenges
      that developers face. It enhanced my ability to solve problems. As a
      self-taught programmer, I was able to acquire a strong commitment and
      passion. I'm a full stack developer. I have great foundation in some of
      programming languages like javascript, java, python and go. I also been
      continuously been learning the cloud native technology like docker,
      kubernetes, service mesh. I hope to learn how to be responsible as
      developer. The LFX mentorship will also empower me to hone my abilities
      and lay a solid platform for my future contributions to open source.
